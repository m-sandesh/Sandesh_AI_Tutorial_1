### Introduction to AI and Intelligence
<p align="justify"> AI stand for Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems. Artificial intelligence is also the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. <br> In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. Experts regard artificial intelligence as a factor of production, which has the potential to introduce new sources of growth and change the way work is done across industries. For instance, this PWC article predicts that AI could potentially contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2035. China and the United States are primed to benefit the most from the coming AI boom, accounting for nearly 70% of the global impact. <br>

### AI Perspectives: Acting & Thinking Humanly and Rationally
**Acting and Thinking Humanly**
<p align="justify"> The first proposal for success in building a program and acts humanly was the Turing Test. To be considered intelligent a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator. A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously. If after a reasonable period, the interrogator cannot tell which is which, the program passes. To pass this test requires: natural language processing, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning. <br> This test avoids physical contact and concentrates on "higher level" mental faculties. A total Turing test would require the program to also do computer vision and robotics <br> Thinking this humanly, this requires "getting inside" of the human mind to see how it works and then comparing our computer programs to this. This is what cognitive science attempts to do. Another way to do this is to observe a human problem solving and argue that one's programs go about problem solving in a similar way. Example: GPS (General Problem Solver) was an early computer program that attempted to model human thinking. The developers were not so much interested in whether or not GPS solved problems correctly. They were more interested in showing that it solved problems like people, going through the same steps and taking around the same amount of time to perform those steps.

**Acting and Thinking Rationally**
<p align="justify"> Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs. An agent is just something that perceives and acts.
In the logical approach to AI, the emphasis is on correct inferences. This is often part of being a rational agent because one way to act rationally is to reason logically and then act on ones conclusions. But this is not all of rationality because agents often find themselves in situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet they must do something. There are also ways to act rationally that do not seem to involve inference, e.g., reflex actions. The study of AI as rational agent design has two advantages: 

* It is more general than the logical approach because correct inference is only a useful mechanism for achieving rationality, not a necessary one.
* It is more amenable to scientific development than approaches based on human behaviour or human thought because a standard of rationality can be defined independent of humans. 

<p align="justify">  Achieving perfect rationality in complex environments is not possible because the computational demands are too high. However, we will study perfect rationality as a starting place. <br> Thinking rationally, Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify "thinking". His syllogisms provided patterns of argument structure that always gave correct conclusions, giving correct premises. Example: All computers use energy. Using energy always generates heat. Therefore, all computers generate heat. Building the Formal Logic was the first step toward enabling computer programs to reason logically. By 1965, programs existed that could, given enough time and memory, take a description of the problem in logical notation and find the solution, if one existed. The logicist tradition in AI hopes to build on such programs to create intelligence. There are two main obstacles to this approach: First, it is difficult to make informal knowledge precise enough to use the logicist approach particularly when there is uncertainty in the knowledge. Second, there is a big difference between being able to solve a problem in principle and doing so in practice <br>

### History of AI
Here’s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.
* 1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.
* 1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.
* 1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.
* 2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 
* 2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.
* 2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. 

### Foundations of AI
**Psychology** <p align="justify"> The principle characteristic of cognitive psychology is that the brain processes and processes information. The claim is that beliefs, goals, and reasoning steps can be useful components of a theory of human behaviour. The knowledge-based agent has three key steps: 
* Stimulus is translated into an internal representation
* The representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal representations
* These are translated into actions later.

**Linguistics** <p align="justify"> Having a theory of how humans successfully process natural language is an AI-complete problem - if we could solve this problem then we would have created a model of intelligence. Much of the early work in knowledge representation was done in support of programs that attempted natural language understanding.

**Mathematics** <p align="justify">  Philosophers staked out most of the important ideas of AI, but to move to a formal science requires a level of mathematical formalism in three main areas: computation, logic and probability. Mathematicians have proved that there exists an algorithm to prove any true statement in first-order logic. However, if one adds the principle of induction required to capture the semantics of the natural numbers, then this is no longer the case. Specifically, the incompleteness theorem showed that in any language expressive enough to describe the properties of the natural numbers, there are true statements that are undecidable: their truth cannot be established by any algorithm.

**Economics** <p align="justify">  AI takes the following ideas from economics.
* How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff (utility)? <p align="justify"> Decision theory, which combines probability theory. With utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decision made under uncertainty. This is suitable for large “economics” where each agent need pay no attention to the action of the other gent as individuals.
* How should we do this when others may not go along? <p align="justify"> For small economics, the situation is much more like a game. The action of one player can significantly affect the utility of another. Unlike decision theory game theory does not offer an unambiguous prescription for selecting actions.
* How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future? <p align="justify"> For the most part economist did not address this question. This topic was pursed in the field of operation research (OR).

**Neuroscience** <p align="justify"> Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, particularly the brain. This study of how brain process information directly help in the development of AI.

**Control Theory** <p align="justify"> Control theory and cybernetics deals with the self controlling machine. Modern control theory has its goal to design the system that maximize an objective function overtime. This roughly match the AI view: designing system that behave optimally.

**Computer Engineering** <p align="justify"> For AI to succeed, we need two things: Intelligence and artifact, and the computer has been the artifact of the choice.

### Applications of AI
